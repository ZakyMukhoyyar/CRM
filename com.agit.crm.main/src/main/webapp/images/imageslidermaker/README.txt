Step by step instructions
-------------------------

1. Paste the following into the head of your HTML file:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="ism/css/my-slider.css"/>
<script src="ism/js/ism-2.2.min.js"></script>


2. Paste this into the body of your HTML file (at the location where:
   you would like your slider to appear in the page):

<div class="ism-slider" id="my-slider">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <img src="ism/image/slides/_u/1531128712409_971929.jpg">
      <div class="ism-caption ism-caption-0"></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="ism/image/slides/_u/1531128706871_309011.jpg">
      <div class="ism-caption ism-caption-0"></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="ism/image/slides/_u/1531128696440_629803.jpg">
      <div class="ism-caption ism-caption-0"></div>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p class="ism-badge" id="my-slider-ism-badge"><a class="ism-link" href="http://imageslidermaker.com" rel="nofollow">generated with ISM</a></p>


3. Copy the ism/ directory into the root directory of your project.

   The css, js and image paths are relative, meaning the ism/
   directory should be in the same directory (path) as your HTML
   file containing the slider.
